# project_netflix
A recommendation system for movies based on imdb

This is the second project done at Wild Code School.
Using the international movie database (imdb.com) we made a recommendation algorithm based on genre, note, number of votes and certain film directors.

The project work was done in python, and we made a visualisation on streamlit.
